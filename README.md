# jev-router

A local model router for Claude Code and the Codex CLI that picks a model tier for each human turn with Jev.

jev-router is a pass-through proxy that runs on your own Mac or Linux machine. Claude Code talks to it in Anthropic
Messages and Codex in OpenAI Responses. When you write a new message, the router asks [Jev](https://docs.typesafe.ai),
TypeSafe AI's System One decision model, which tier the work needs, and sends the session to a fast, balanced or
frontier model.

Many turns in a coding session don't need the most expensive model. Switching models in the middle of a task costs
more than it saves, though: the prompt cache is per model, and a stronger model that inherits a weaker model's
half-done transcript [recovers only part of the quality gap](https://arxiv.org/abs/2608.24358). So the router
decides only when a person writes, and within a session it only moves up.

Requests go upstream unchanged except for `model`, the credential, and fields a target can't accept. Responses,
SSE included, stream back byte for byte. Node.js 22 or newer is all it needs: there are no runtime dependencies, and
you don't need Docker or a clone of this repository.

> **Boundary:** Anthropic doesn't support routing Claude Code to non-Claude models through a gateway
> ([Claude Code docs](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/llm-gateway)). `jev-router setup` keeps Claude Code on Claude
> models unless you pick its Ollama Cloud option.

## Quick start

jev-router is a small server that runs on your machine. Claude Code sends its requests to it instead of to
Anthropic. For each message you write, the router asks Jev which model the work needs, and forwards the request to
that model. `jev-router setup` runs the router in the background, so you don't have to start it yourself.

Two commands set it up:

```bash
npx @ediri/jev-router setup
claude
```

npx asks before it downloads the package. You can also install jev-router first, with
`npm install -g @ediri/jev-router`, and then run `jev-router setup`. To run it from GitHub instead of the npm
registry, use `npx github:dirien/jev-router setup`, which needs git.

Don't run `npx jev-router` or `npm install -g jev-router`. Without the `@ediri/` scope, that name belongs to an
unrelated project, [gargpratyush/jev-router](https://github.com/gargpratyush/jev-router). Run setup as your own user,
not with `sudo`: it sets up jev-router for the user who runs it, and refuses to run as root for someone else.

### What setup does

Setup asks three questions:

1. **Which models Claude Code uses.** The default is Claude only: Haiku 4.5, Sonnet 5 and Opus 5.5. The other
   option sends quick work to Ollama Cloud's `glm-5.3-flash`.
1. **Your keys.** Jev needs a key from [TypeSafe](https://console.typesafe.ai) or [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai).
   The Ollama option also needs an Ollama key. Setup checks the Jev key with one call, which costs about $0.00003.
   There's no Anthropic key to enter: Claude Code keeps using your own Claude login.
1. **Whether to run the router in the background.** Press Enter for yes.

Then setup:

- saves your keys in `~/.config/jev-router/env`, a file only you can read;
- installs jev-router with npm, if you ran setup through npx, because the background service needs a copy that stays;
- starts the router as a launchd agent on macOS, or a systemd user service on Linux, and starts it again whenever you
  log in;
- points Claude Code at the router in `~/.claude/settings.json`, after it keeps a backup of that file.

Restart any Claude Code session that was already running. You can run setup again at any time: it keeps your config
and your saved keys (press Enter), and restarts the router.

If Claude Code already goes to another gateway, such as a company LiteLLM with an `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`, setup
leaves its settings alone and says what to remove first. Behind the router, Claude Code would send that gateway's
credentials to Anthropic.

- **Check it:** `jev-router doctor` lists the config, the keys, the service, and whether the router answers.
- **Watch it:** open <http://127.0.0.1:4100>. Each message you write shows up with the model the router picked, and
  why.
- **Upgrade:** `npx @ediri/jev-router@latest setup` installs the newest version and restarts the router.
- **Undo it:** `jev-router uninstall` stops the router and takes setup's changes back out of Claude Code's settings.
  It keeps your config, keys and logs, and prints the command that deletes them.

### Without a background service

Setup can't install a service on a machine without launchd or a systemd user session, such as a container. There,
and when you answer no, it saves your keys and stops. Then start Claude Code through the router for one session:

```bash
jev-router launch claude              # through npx: npx @ediri/jev-router launch claude
jev-router launch claude --ui 4100    # the same, with the live view on http://127.0.0.1:4100
```

`launch` starts a router for the session and stops it when Claude Code exits. Setup prints the exact command for
the way you installed jev-router.

To run each step yourself instead, see [Manual setup](docs/activation.md#manual-setup).

## Tiers

| Client | `fast` | `balanced` | `frontier` | `trusted` (sessions that contained a secret) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Claude Code, setup's default (Claude only) | Anthropic `claude-haiku-4-5` | Anthropic `claude-sonnet-5` | Anthropic `claude-opus-5-5` | Anthropic `claude-sonnet-5` |
| Claude Code, setup's Ollama option | Ollama Cloud `glm-5.3-flash` | Anthropic `claude-sonnet-5` | Anthropic `claude-opus-5-5` | Anthropic `claude-sonnet-5` |
| Codex CLI | Ollama Cloud `glm-5.3-flash` | Ollama Cloud `kimi-k2.7-code` | OpenAI `gpt-6-astra` | OpenAI `gpt-6-sol` |

Setup's default writes [`config/anthropic-only.json`](config/anthropic-only.json) to
`~/.config/jev-router/config.json`. The Ollama option writes [`config/default.json`](config/default.json) instead,
which changes only Claude Code's `fast` tier; the router also uses that file when you have no config. Claude Code's
own background calls (session titles, topic checks, quota probes) go to `claude-haiku-4-5` in both. Codex routes the
same way in both configs. The OpenAI model names come from Codex's bundled model catalog, so check them against your
account.

## Install

The [Quick start](#quick-start) installs jev-router for you. To install it yourself, or to pin a version:

```bash
npm install -g @ediri/jev-router                     # the newest release
npm install -g @ediri/jev-router@1.5.0               # one release
npm install -g github:dirien/jev-router#semver:^1    # the newest 1.x from GitHub, which needs git
```

To update, run the install command again.

Up to 1.4.0 the package was called `@dirien/jev-router`. If you installed one of those versions, run
`npm uninstall -g @dirien/jev-router` before you install a newer one: npm won't replace a command that another
package owns.

What else you need:

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Node.js | 22 or newer, on macOS or Linux |
| Jev | A [TypeSafe](https://console.typesafe.ai) API key, an [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai) key with credits, or both for failover |
| Anthropic | Your Claude login. The router passes it through, so there's no Anthropic key to set |
| Ollama Cloud | An API key for Claude Code's `fast` tier with setup's Ollama option, and for Codex's `fast` and `balanced` tiers |
| OpenAI | An API key for Codex's `frontier` and `trusted` tiers. You don't need one if you only use Claude Code |
| Claude Code | 2.1.273 or newer, for the gateway hint headers (request shapes taken from 2.1.281) |
| Codex CLI | 0.134.0 or newer, for profile files (request shapes taken from 0.156.1) |

To remove jev-router, run `jev-router uninstall`, then `npm uninstall -g @ediri/jev-router`. Your config, keys and
session state stay in `~/.config/jev-router` and `~/.local/state/jev-router` until you delete them.

## Use it with Claude Code

`jev-router setup` points every Claude Code session at the router. Claude Code needs four environment variables to
work through the router, and there are three ways to set them:

- **For every session.** Setup puts them in the `env` block of `~/.claude/settings.json` and runs the router as a
  service. While the router is down, Claude Code can't connect.
- **For one run.** `jev-router launch claude` sets them for one Claude Code session and exits with Claude Code's exit
  code. If no router answers on the port, it starts one inside its own process, with the keys from
  `~/.config/jev-router/env`. Claude Code doesn't get the file's variables.
- **For one shell.** With the router running, `eval "$(jev-router env claude)"` exports them, and every `claude` you
  start from that shell goes through the router.

This is what setup adds to `~/.claude/settings.json`, next to the keys the file already has:

```json
{
  "env": {
    "ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL": "http://127.0.0.1:4000",
    "CLAUDE_CODE_GATEWAY_HINT_HEADERS": "1",
    "CLAUDE_CODE_AUTO_COMPACT_WINDOW": "160000",
    "ENABLE_TOOL_SEARCH": "true"
  }
}
```

| Variable | Why |
| --- | --- |
| `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` | Sends Claude Code's API traffic to the router |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_GATEWAY_HINT_HEADERS=1` | Labels each request as main loop, subagent, compaction, workflow or background work, so only your messages decide the tier |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_AUTO_COMPACT_WINDOW=160000` | Claude Code can't learn the routed model's context window through a gateway. 160,000 tokens compacts before the smallest window among the tiers |
| `ENABLE_TOOL_SEARCH=true` | Behind any gateway, Claude Code turns MCP tool search off and sends every MCP tool definition with every request. In a live test with a few MCP servers, that was about 200,000 tokens per request, more than the compaction window, so Claude Code compacted on every message |

Setup doesn't overwrite a compaction window or a tool search setting you already have. When the router has a token,
setup also adds it to `ANTHROPIC_CUSTOM_HEADERS`. When `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`, in the settings file or in your shell,
already points somewhere else, such as a company gateway, setup asks before it replaces it, and `--yes` keeps it.

Setup never replaces it when Claude Code also carries credentials for that gateway: `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`,
`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` or custom headers, in your shell or the settings file, or an `apiKeyHelper`. Behind the router,
Claude Code would send them to Anthropic. Setup names them, and where they're set, so you can remove them first.
`launch claude` and `env claude` refuse in the same case, and show the command that leaves them out.

You don't need an Anthropic API key: the router passes Claude Code's own login to Anthropic and to no other host. If
the router's environment has an `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, the router uses that key for every Anthropic request instead,
and the key pays.

`jev-router doctor` checks these settings. When `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` in your shell or in `~/.claude/settings.json`
points at the router, it names each of the other three that's missing. [docs/activation.md](docs/activation.md)
covers a router token, undoing each setup, and troubleshooting.

## Use it with Codex

```bash
jev-router launch codex
```

`launch codex` writes a `jev` profile to `~/.codex/jev.config.toml` and runs `codex --profile jev`. Like
`launch claude`, it uses the router on the port or starts one, and arguments after `--` go to `codex`. A profile that
`launch` wrote is refreshed when the router's port or token changes; a profile you edited is kept, and `--force`
replaces it. Once the profile exists, plain `codex --profile jev` works too while a router runs.

Setup asks only for the keys Claude Code needs. Codex also needs `OLLAMA_API_KEY` and `OPENAI_API_KEY`: add them to
`~/.config/jev-router/env`, one `KEY=value` line each, and run `jev-router setup` again so the router picks them up.

The profile talks to one virtual model, `jev-auto`, from
[`examples/codex/jev-models.json`](examples/codex/jev-models.json). Codex shapes every request from the model's
catalog entry (tool types, shell type, parallel tool calls), so the entry uses settings every routed model can handle.
It also carries Codex's own system prompt: an empty prompt there would silently drop Codex's instructions. To set the
profile up by hand, see [Codex profile by hand](docs/activation.md#codex-profile-by-hand).

## Run it as a service

`jev-router setup` installs the service for you: a launchd agent on macOS
(`~/Library/LaunchAgents/io.github.dirien.jev-router.plist`) or a systemd user unit on Linux
(`~/.config/systemd/user/jev-router.service`). It keeps one router running for all your sessions, starts when you
log in, and restarts the router if it fails. It runs `jev-router serve --ui 4100` with your config, your env file and
the log file.

Setup writes the service from the templates in the package, under `examples/service/`, which are also the manual
route. [docs/activation.md](docs/activation.md#run-the-router-as-a-service) has the commands to install, reload,
restart and remove each service by hand. `jev-router uninstall` removes the service setup installed.

The router's JSON log goes to `~/.local/state/jev-router/router.log` and rotates at 50 MiB. `jev-router report` and
`jev-router ui` read that file without an argument. Messages for people, such as startup errors, go to
`~/Library/Logs/jev-router/router.err.log` on macOS, and to the journal (`journalctl --user -u jev-router`) on Linux.
On Linux, the service runs while you're logged in; `loginctl enable-linger` keeps it running after you log out.

## Watch routing live

The live view shows every decision as it happens, in a browser next to the terminal where Claude Code runs:

![The live view with a request selected: Jev rated it mechanical at 86%, and its route through the router, the
category and the fast tier to Haiku 4.5 streams across the flow while the rest of the graph dims](docs/live-view.png)

- **Latest decision.** Jev's category for the message you just sent, its probabilities against each tier's
  threshold, the guards, and the tier and model the router picked, with the reason in plain words. When the router
  passes over Jev's tier, the panel says why, for example "82% sure · Jev's tier fast ✗ 82% is under its 85% bar →
  balanced".
- **Flow.** An animated graph from Claude Code or Codex through Jev's categories and the tiers to the models. Every
  request travels it as a dot; tool-loop steps, subagents and background calls skip Jev.
- **Timeline and sessions.** Each request with its status, tokens and cost, grouped under the message that started
  it, and each session's tier per human message, so the ratchet shows.
- **Totals.** Spend against the baseline model, Jev's latency and its fallbacks.
- **Any request, on a click.** Click a request in the timeline, or focus it and press Enter, and the decision panel
  and the flow switch to it: its route streams across the graph in its tier's color. A tool step, subagent or
  compaction shows the prompt whose decision it runs on; a background call shows that it always takes `side`.
  Escape, or **Back to live**, follows the traffic again.

The service that setup installs serves the view on port 4100. `serve --ui` and `launch --ui` (or `JEV_ROUTER_UI`)
take a port or `host:port`, and `launch` prints the view's address before Claude Code starts. The view gets every log
entry from the router in-process and needs no log file. It listens on loopback unless you give it an address.

For a router started without `--ui`, `jev-router ui [<log.jsonl>] [--port <n>]` serves the same view on
`http://127.0.0.1:4100` by following the router's log.

- **A token for the view.** Set `JEV_ROUTER_UI_TOKEN`, or pass `--ui-token`, and the view asks for that token. The
  router prints an address that ends in `?token=`; open it, and the page keeps the token in a cookie. Prefer the
  variable, which can also live in your env file, because other users can see a flag in `ps`.
- **Another address.** `--ui 0.0.0.0:4100` lets other machines reach the view, for port forwarding such as
  `sbx ports`. Without a token, the router warns that anyone who can reach that address can watch routing decisions.
  The router's own port still refuses every browser request.

## How routing works

The router tracks each conversation as a **session**. It takes the session ID from Claude Code's
`X-Claude-Code-Session-Id` header or `metadata.user_id`, from Codex's `session-id` or `thread-id` header, from
`prompt_cache_key`, or else from a hash of the system prompt and the first messages. The log names the source as
`key_source`.

| Request | Tier | Asks Jev? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `count_tokens` | The session's tier. A target with `countTokens: false` (Ollama Cloud) answers with a local 404, and Claude Code estimates instead | no |
| Background call: request class `auxiliary`, Codex memory consolidation, a `max_tokens <= 1` probe, or a `haiku` model when no request class is sent | `side`: `claude-haiku-4-5` for Claude Code, the `fast` target for Codex | no |
| Subagent, compaction, workflow | The session's tier | no |
| `x-jev-tier` header or `JEV_ROUTER_TIER` | That tier | no |
| `/model` switch to another model family in Claude Code | The family's tier from `modelPins` | no |
| `#fast`, `#balanced` or `#frontier` as the first or last word you type | That tier | no |
| Tool-loop step (no new human message) | The session's tier | no |
| New human message | Jev's answer through the policy: freely for a new, idle or provisional session, and only upward otherwise | yes, once per message |

Then, for every request, the router:

1. **Picks the target.** A session whose human messages contained a secret uses the `trusted` target from then on.
1. **Strips foreign reasoning.** When a session moves to another upstream host (Ollama Cloud to Anthropic, say),
   signed thinking from before the move is dropped, because another provider's signatures are always rejected.
   Between Anthropic models nothing is stripped, and subagent and compacted conversations are never touched.
1. **Redacts.** For an untrusted target it redacts secrets anywhere in the body, tool output included.
1. **Drops unsupported fields.** It removes the fields the target lists in `omit`, for example the adaptive
   `thinking`, `output_config.effort` and `context_management` that Haiku 4.5 rejects.
1. **Caps the output.** It lowers `max_tokens` to what the target's model accepts. Claude Code asks for 128,000
   output tokens because it believes it talks to Opus 5.5, and Haiku 4.5 refuses anything above 64,000. The limits
   of the Claude models in the shipped configs are built in, and a target's `maxOutputTokens` overrides them.
1. **Folds system messages.** Claude Code puts `role: "system"` messages inside the conversation for the Claude 5
   family. Haiku 4.5 rejects them, so for any other model the router folds each into the user message it follows,
   as `<system-reminder>` text after that message's tool results; the tools such a message adds join `tools`. A
   target's `foldSystemMessages` overrides it.
1. **Drops betas the model rejects.** Once Claude Code's own model has a 1M window, it asks for the 1M-context
   beta, which Haiku 4.5 refuses on a subscription. The router leaves it out for Haiku; a target's `omitBetas`
   overrides that.
1. **Trims identifiers.** An untrusted target gets a minimal set of headers and no `metadata`.
1. **Forwards.** It streams the response back with back-pressure, and cancels the upstream request when the client
   goes away.

Every decision is in the log and in the response headers `x-jev-tier`, `x-jev-model`, `x-jev-reason` and
`x-jev-session` (plus `x-jev-redacted` when something was redacted, and `x-jev-max-tokens` when `max_tokens` was
lowered).

**Choosing the tier yourself:**

- Put `#frontier` as the first or last word of a message. A tag inside a code block or mid-sentence doesn't count.
- Send `x-jev-tier: frontier`: through `ANTHROPIC_CUSTOM_HEADERS` for Claude Code, or `http_headers` in the Codex
  profile. Set `JEV_ROUTER_TIER` on the router to pin every session.
- Use `/model opus` in Claude Code. With `pinOnModelChange` on (the default), a switch to another model family pins
  that family's tier.
- Run `/clear` in Claude Code for a new session, which Jev decides from scratch.

None of these can move a session that contained a secret to an untrusted upstream.

[docs/design.md](docs/design.md) explains why the router works this way, with sources.

## How it compares

[docs/comparison.md](docs/comparison.md) compares jev-router in detail with four other projects that route coding
agents with Jev, and lists a few more it didn't test. Its summary:

| Project | Clients and upstreams | When Jev decides | Claude Code on a Haiku 4.5 tier | Pick it for |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| jev-router 1.5.0 | Claude Code and Codex, each on its own protocol; Anthropic, OpenAI, Ollama Cloud | Once per human message; a session only moves up | Rejected fields dropped, `max_tokens` capped, system messages folded, 1M beta dropped (live) | Your own Claude Code and Codex sessions, with Claude, OpenAI or Ollama Cloud tiers |
| LiteLLM 1.102.1 | Messages, Responses, Chat Completions; 100+ providers, with translation | Every request by default, tool-loop steps included (mock) | `max_tokens` capped, thinking converted; system messages passed through (mock) | A team gateway: virtual keys, budgets, spend tracking, an admin UI |
| Jevonian 0.1.7 | Messages, Responses, Chat Completions, bridged; many providers | Every request; the model can change on any turn (mock) | Turns Jev sends to Haiku fail with a 400 (live) | Many clients and providers behind one local endpoint, with a dashboard |
| gargpratyush/jev-router 0.3.0 | Claude Code to Anthropic, Codex to OpenAI | Each new user turn, unless a system message follows it (mock) | Thinking and effort dropped; `max_tokens` and system messages passed through (mock) | Same-vendor tiering, also on Windows; last commit 2026-09-19 |
| Switchboard 0.1.0 | Claude Code to Anthropic, Codex to OpenAI or ChatGPT | Once per conversation (docs) | Thinking and effort dropped; `max_tokens` and system messages passed through (source) | Packaged same-vendor tiering that also sets the reasoning effort |

Each project was checked on 2026-09-25. The labels say how: *live* against Anthropic's API, *mock* against mock
upstreams and a mock Jev, *source* by reading the code, and *docs* from the project's documentation.

Where jev-router does better:

- **Claude Code keeps working on a cheaper Claude model.** In live checks, five request shapes broke Claude Code turns
  routed to Haiku 4.5, and jev-router adapts all five. LiteLLM, gargpratyush/jev-router and Switchboard adapt thinking
  and effort, but none of the other routers folds the system messages that Claude Code puts inside the conversation.
- **MCP tool search stays on.** `launch claude`, `env claude` and the example env file set `ENABLE_TOOL_SEARCH=true`.
  Of the others, only LiteLLM's `lite` CLI sets it for you.
- **Models change only at human messages.** A tool loop never switches models, so it keeps its prompt cache, and
  within a session the tier only moves up.
- **Every decision is visible.** Each request leaves a `route` line with its reason, and in the live view you can
  click any request to see Jev's answer, each tier's threshold and the guards.
- **Secrets stay with trusted upstreams.** A scanner checks every human message. A hit keeps the session on its
  trusted target, and untrusted targets get the secrets redacted.
- **It runs as a service.** `jev-router setup` installs it in one command. Session tiers survive a restart, `SIGHUP`
  reloads the config, and one router serves every Claude Code session that `settings.json` points at it.

For a team gateway with virtual keys and budgets, many clients behind one endpoint, or same-vendor tiering on
Windows, another project fits better. [When to pick something else](docs/comparison.md#when-to-pick-something-else)
says which.

## Docker Sandboxes

jev-router doesn't need Docker Sandboxes. If your agents run in one, the
[jev-router kit](sbx/jev-router-kit/spec.yaml) keeps the upstream keys on the host: you store them with
`sbx secret set`, and the sandbox proxy adds them to outgoing requests. Three steps differ from a plain machine:

- Create the sandbox with the kit: `sbx create --kit ghcr.io/dirien/jev-router-kit:1.5.0 claude <workspace>`.
- In the sandbox, install jev-router with the same `npm install -g` command, and start the router with
  `jev-router serve --ui 0.0.0.0:4100`, so the view can be forwarded. A sandbox has no service manager, and the kit
  provides the keys, so `jev-router setup` isn't needed there.
- On the host, forward the view with `sbx ports <name> --publish 4100:4100`, and pass Claude Code's four variables
  to `sbx run` with `-e`.

[docs/sandbox.md](docs/sandbox.md) has the full steps, including how to use the kit from git instead of GHCR.

## Operations

- **Logs.** `serve` writes one JSON line per event to stdout, and to a file when you pass `--log-file` (or set
  `JEV_ROUTER_LOG_FILE`, or `logFile` in the config). A router that `launch` started logs to
  `~/.local/state/jev-router/router.log` instead of stdout, so the agent's terminal stays clean. A log file rotates
  to `<file>.1` when it would grow past `logMaxBytes` (50 MiB by default; `0` turns rotation off), and one old file
  is kept. If a log file can't be written, the router says so once and goes on routing.
- **Report.** `jev-router report [<log.jsonl>]` sums up a log: requests and sessions, spend per model, cost against
  the baseline and the savings, and Jev's call count, fallback rate, p50 and p95 latency and cost. Without an
  argument it reads `JEV_ROUTER_LOG_FILE`, else `logFile` from the config, else
  `~/.local/state/jev-router/router.log`, together with its rotated `.1` file. Lines that aren't JSON are skipped.
- **Health.** `GET /healthz` returns the version, uptime, the session count, active requests, and each Jev channel's
  calls, errors, last error and circuit state. It needs no token.
- **State.** Decisions persist in `stateFile`, so a restart doesn't move live sessions to another model. Entries
  expire after seven days, and the router compacts the file to one line per session at startup and while it runs.
- **Signals.** `SIGHUP` re-reads and re-validates the config; if the new config is invalid, the old one stays in
  effect. It doesn't reload keys: restart the router after you change the env file. `SIGTERM` and `SIGINT` stop new
  connections and wait up to 30 seconds for streams in flight, and a second signal stops the router at once.
- **Validation.** A bad config stops the router at startup with every problem listed.

```bash
jev-router report                    # reads ~/.local/state/jev-router/router.log when nothing else is set
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:4000/healthz
pgrep -f 'jev-router serve'          # the router's process ID
kill -HUP <pid>                      # reload its config
```

| Log line | When | What it holds |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `route` | A request is routed | Session hash, request kind, tier, reason, model and upstream. After a Jev call, also the channel, model version, request ID, probabilities, guard values and latency |
| `done` | A request ends | Status, bytes, the SHA-256 of the streamed bytes, token usage, `cost_usd`, and `baseline_usd`: the same usage priced on `baselineModel`. `capped_max_tokens` and `folded_system` when the router changed the request, and the upstream's `error` message when it failed. Status 499 when the client left before the upstream answered |
| `error` | The router couldn't handle a request or reach its upstream, or the upstream broke off a stream | What failed. A broken stream also gets a `done` line with the usage so far and an `error`, even after a 200 |
| `deciding` | A Jev call starts | The session and its turn |
| `config` | At startup and after every reload | The tiers, Jev's options, and each target's model and host, never keys |
| `warning` | Once per problem | For example, Claude Code requests without hint headers, an unknown tier pin, or a log file that can't be written |

A `req` number pairs each `route` line with its `done` line.

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `setup` | Asks which models Claude Code uses and for their keys, checks the Jev key with one call, then saves them, runs the router in the background and points Claude Code at it. Safe to run again. `--yes` answers with the defaults and takes the keys from the environment |
| `uninstall` | Removes the service and what setup put in Claude Code's settings. Keeps the config, the keys and the logs |
| `serve` | Runs the router in the foreground; it's the default command. `--ui` also serves the live view |
| `launch` | Runs Claude Code or Codex through the router on the configured port, and starts one if none runs. `--ui` also serves the live view of a router it starts |
| `env` | Prints shell exports for a running router: `eval "$(jev-router env claude)"` |
| `doctor` | Checks the config, the env file, the keys, the log file, the service, Claude Code's settings and a running router. `--live` makes one Jev call (about $0.00003) |
| `init` | Writes the user config. `--anthropic-only` sends every Claude Code tier to Anthropic |
| `report` | Sums up requests, spend and savings from a router log |
| `ui` | Serves the live view for a log that another process writes |

`setup` also takes `--models claude|ollama` (the config for a machine without one), `--service auto|launchd|systemd|none`
(`auto` picks launchd on macOS and systemd on Linux, when a user session is there) and `--no-claude-settings`.
`JEV_ROUTER_CLAUDE_BIN` and `JEV_ROUTER_CODEX_BIN` point `launch` at a specific `claude` or `codex` binary.

## Configuration

The router reads the first config it finds:

1. the file passed with `--config`
1. `JEV_ROUTER_CONFIG`
1. `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/jev-router/config.json` (`~/.config/jev-router/config.json` by default)
1. the packaged [`config/default.json`](config/default.json)

`jev-router setup` writes `~/.config/jev-router/config.json` when there's none, from
[`config/anthropic-only.json`](config/anthropic-only.json) or, with its Ollama option, from
[`config/default.json`](config/default.json). `jev-router init` does the same without the rest of setup.
[docs/configuration.md](docs/configuration.md) documents every key, its default and its validation.

| Key | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `tiers`, `defaultTier` | Tier names, cheapest first, and the tier a new session gets when Jev can't decide |
| `policy.mode` | `ratchet` (default) re-decides at each human message and only moves up; `sticky` decides once per session |
| `policy.accept` | Minimum probability per tier. Cheap tiers need more; below it, the more capable of the top two wins |
| `policy.sensitiveOverride`, `policy.claimGuard` | Guard thresholds |
| `policy.maxProvisional`, `policy.idleResetMinutes`, `policy.failClosed` | Retries after Jev failures, the idle reset, and whether unvetted sessions use trusted targets |
| `jev.channels` | Ordered System One channels, each with `baseUrl`, `model` (pin a version such as `jev-1.13.0`), `keyEnv` and `timeoutMs` |
| `jev.deadlineMs`, `jev.requestChars` | The total Jev budget per decision, and the size cap for the latest message |
| `jev.question`, `jev.options` | The rubric: one choice question with `what`, `examples` and `not_for` per option, and each option's `tier` |
| `surfaces.<anthropic\|openai>.<tier\|side\|trusted>` | Targets: `url`, `model`, `auth` (`x-api-key` or `bearer`), `keyEnv`, `clientAuth`, `trusted`, `countTokens`, `omit`, `maxOutputTokens`, `foldSystemMessages`, `omitBetas` |
| `prices`, `baselineModel` | USD per million tokens for the cost ledger, and the model savings are measured against |
| `sideCallModel`, `pinOnModelChange`, `modelPins` | Background-call detection, and model family to tier for `/model` switches |
| `host`, `port`, `token`, `allowedHosts`, `allowedOrigins`, `maxBodyBytes`, `maxSessions`, `stateFile` | Server settings |
| `logFile`, `logMaxBytes` | A file for the JSON log besides stdout, and the size at which it rotates (50 MiB; `0` never rotates) |

Keys come from the environment, or from an env file of `KEY=value` lines, `~/.config/jev-router/env`, which setup
writes:

- `serve`, `launch`, `env`, `doctor` and `setup` load that file when it exists. `--env-file`, or
  `JEV_ROUTER_ENV_FILE`, names another one, and `/dev/null` turns it off.
- Setup saves a `JEV_ROUTER_HOST` or `JEV_ROUTER_PORT` you set in your shell there too, so the service and every other
  command find the router at the same address.
- Variables that are already set win over the file. A leading `~` in the path is expanded, for services that start
  without a shell.
- The router warns when other users can read or change the file.
- Proxy settings and `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS` have no effect from the file, because Node reads them only when it starts.
- A file that is named but missing stops the command. For `--env-file`, Node prints `node: <path>: not found` and
  exits with status 9 before jev-router runs.

| Environment variable | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `TYPESAFE_API_KEY`, `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | Jev channel keys (the shipped channels' `keyEnv`) |
| `OLLAMA_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY` | Upstream keys for Ollama Cloud and OpenAI |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Optional. Without it, Claude Code's own login goes to Anthropic |
| `JEV_ROUTER_ENV_FILE` | The env file to load instead of `~/.config/jev-router/env`, when `--env-file` isn't given; setup writes the keys there. `/dev/null` turns the env file off |
| `JEV_ROUTER_CONFIG` | Config file, after `--config` |
| `JEV_ROUTER_HOST`, `JEV_ROUTER_PORT` | Listen address, overriding the config. Setup saves them in the env file |
| `JEV_ROUTER_LOG_FILE` | The log file for `serve`, when `--log-file` isn't given; `report` and `ui` read it too |
| `JEV_ROUTER_TOKEN` | Shared secret clients send as `x-jev-router-token`; required for a non-loopback address |
| `JEV_ROUTER_UI`, `JEV_ROUTER_UI_TOKEN` | The live view's address, like `--ui`, and its token, like `--ui-token` |
| `JEV_ROUTER_TIER` | Pin every session to one tier |
| `JEV_ROUTER_CLAUDE_BIN`, `JEV_ROUTER_CODEX_BIN` | The `claude` and `codex` binaries `launch` runs |
| `JEV_ROUTER_SETUP_WAIT` | How many seconds setup waits for the service's router to answer (15) |
| `JEV_BASE_URL`, `JEV_MODEL`, `JEV_API_KEY` | Add an extra System One channel in front of the configured ones |

## Security and privacy

- **Loopback by default.** The router listens on `127.0.0.1:4000`. It refuses a `Host` header other than
  `127.0.0.1`, `localhost` or `[::1]` on its port (DNS rebinding), any request with an `Origin` header (browser tabs),
  and bodies that aren't JSON. It won't listen on a non-loopback address unless `JEV_ROUTER_TOKEN` is set; clients
  then send the token as `x-jev-router-token`.
- **Keys stay with their hosts.** Each key comes from the environment variable its target or Jev channel names, and
  goes only to that host. Upstream redirects are refused, so a key can't follow one. Your Claude login is forwarded
  only to targets marked `clientAuth` (Anthropic). So that another gateway's credentials never reach Anthropic, setup,
  `launch claude` and `env claude` won't route Claude Code while it goes to another gateway with credentials for it.
- **Keys at rest.** Setup saves them in `~/.config/jev-router/env` with mode 0600, and never prints them. You can
  also keep them in your shell environment. `serve`, `launch`, `env`, `doctor` and `setup` warn when other users can
  read or change the env file. `launch` keeps the file's variables out of the agent's environment, so the commands the
  agent runs don't see those keys.
- **What Jev sees.** The latest human message, with harness text removed (system reminders, shell-mode output, hook
  output, command wrappers), code blocks replaced by a one-line summary, secrets scrubbed, and cut to 4,000
  characters keeping its start and end. Plus up to two earlier human messages, the last assistant message for short
  approvals like "yes, go ahead", and named buckets for session depth and recent tool use. Jev never sees tool
  output, file contents or the system prompt, and the questions it answers never name a model.
- **Secrets.** A deterministic scanner checks every human message for private keys, API tokens (Anthropic, OpenAI,
  OpenRouter, AWS, GitHub, GitLab, Slack, Stripe, Google, Pulumi), JWTs, credentials in URLs and `password=`-style
  assignments. A hit keeps the session on the `trusted` target. Untrusted targets get bodies with secrets redacted,
  a minimal set of headers and no `metadata`, so Claude Code's session and account identifiers stay with Anthropic.
  A pattern list can't catch every secret, so don't paste credentials into prompts.
- **What's stored.** The state file (`~/.local/state/jev-router/sessions.jsonl`, mode 0600) holds hashed session
  keys, tiers, trust flags, the last upstream host, and a hash of the message where the provider changed. It holds
  no prompt text. The log files (mode 0600) hold decisions, token usage and cost, never prompt text or keys. Setup
  also records what it changed in Claude Code's settings in `~/.config/jev-router/setup.json`, without keys or the
  router token, so that `uninstall` can undo it.
- **The live view.** It has its own port and only shows log entries: models, tiers and costs, never prompts or
  keys. It listens on `127.0.0.1` unless `--ui` names another address, and an optional token
  (`JEV_ROUTER_UI_TOKEN`) keeps it private on a shared address. It answers only a `Host` that names loopback or the
  address it listens on, refuses a foreign `Origin`, serves nothing but its page and the event stream, and sends a
  Content Security Policy that allows only its own origin.
- **Where prompts go.** A session's requests go to the upstream its tier maps to, and Jev's small state goes to the
  first Jev channel that answers (TypeSafe, then OpenRouter). Check each provider's retention terms before you use
  the router on sensitive code. TypeSafe says Jev isn't trained on customer requests
  ([Models](https://docs.typesafe.ai/models)).

[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) explains how to report a vulnerability.

## Development

To work on jev-router itself, clone the repository. Nothing else in this README needs a clone.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dirien/jev-router.git
cd jev-router
npm ci
npm run check          # Biome, tsc, markdownlint, then the tests with coverage thresholds
npm run test:package   # installs the packed package into a temporary prefix and runs it like a user would
```

The router itself has zero runtime dependencies. The dev tools are [Biome](https://biomejs.dev) for linting and
formatting, TypeScript 7 (`tsc`) to type-check the JSDoc-annotated JavaScript without emitting anything,
[markdownlint-cli2](https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint-cli2) for the docs, and `node:test` with Node's
built-in coverage.

| Script | What it runs |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run lint` | `biome check --error-on-warnings .` |
| `npm run format` | `biome check --write .` |
| `npm run typecheck` | `tsc` in strict `checkJs` mode on the JSDoc types, for the Node code and for `ui/` |
| `npm run lint:md` | `markdownlint-cli2` |
| `npm test` | `node --test test/*.test.mjs`: offline, against mock upstreams and a mock Jev |
| `npm run test:coverage` | The tests with coverage thresholds on `src/**`: lines 85%, branches 75%, functions 85% |
| `npm run check` | `lint`, `typecheck`, `lint:md` and `test:coverage`, the gate CI runs |
| `npm run test:package` | Packs the package, installs it with `npm install -g --prefix` into a temporary directory, and runs `version`, `init`, `serve` with an env file and the live view, `env claude`, `launch claude`, a clean `SIGTERM`, then `setup --yes --service none` against a local Jev stand-in, and `uninstall`, with no network. `-- --git` also installs the last commit from git |
| `npm run test:live` | Three live Anthropic calls with Jev mocked; needs Anthropic credentials |
| `npm run eval` / `npm run eval:mock` | The Jev evaluation on 58 labeled prompts, live or with a keyword stand-in |
| `npm start` | Starts the router (`jev-router serve`) |

CI runs `npm run check` and `npm run test:package -- --git` on Node.js 22 and 24, and lints the workflows with
actionlint.

**Evaluation.** `npm run eval` measures Jev as the router uses it (the same state, questions, channels and policy) on
58 labeled coding-agent prompts: 48 base prompts, 6 prompt-injection variants and 4 firewall probes. It reports
accuracy, under-routing with a 95% Wilson bound, calibration, injection downgrades, latency, cost, and a sweep of the
`fast` threshold. A live run needs a Jev key and costs about $0.002; `npm run eval:mock` checks the harness without
one. The shipped thresholds are starting values that haven't been tuned on real Jev answers yet.
[docs/evaluation.md](docs/evaluation.md) covers the metrics, how to tune `policy.accept`, and the sample sizes to aim
for.

**Releases.** A `vX.Y.Z` tag runs the release workflow, which publishes the GitHub Release and the Docker Sandboxes
kit, and later the npm package. [docs/releasing.md](docs/releasing.md) has the steps.

[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) has the workflow, and [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) the conventions for coding agents.

## Status

The current release is 1.5.0. The offline suite has 152 tests against mock upstreams and a mock Jev, and the package
smoke test installs the packed package and runs it the way a user would.

Live checks on 2026-09-24 ran Claude Code 2.1.281 through the router against Anthropic and found six problems, listed
in [Claude Code compatibility](docs/comparison.md#claude-code-compatibility): five request shapes that broke turns
routed to Haiku 4.5, and MCP tool search. The router now handles the five, and `launch` and `env` set
`ENABLE_TOOL_SEARCH=true`. With Claude Code's full request shape and Jev mocked, Haiku 4.5 (with its `omit` list, and
`max_tokens` lowered from 128,000 to 64,000) and Sonnet 5 both answered 200, the streams were byte-exact, and the
router made one Jev call per human message.

Not verified yet, because it needs keys: thresholds tuned on real Jev answers, Ollama Cloud and OpenAI as live
upstreams, and full Codex sessions, especially Codex's file edits on Ollama models. The Docker Sandboxes kit passes
`sbx kit validate`, but hasn't run in a sandbox end to end. `jev-router setup` hasn't run against a real launchd or
systemd yet: its tests use stand-ins that record each command and start the router from the file setup installed.
